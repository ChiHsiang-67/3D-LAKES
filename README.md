# 3D-LAKES Example Code Repository

This repository contains example code for 3D-Global Lakes (3D-LAKES) dataset. The datest includes the area-elevation (A-E) relationship and three-dimensional bathymetry for 510,530 global lakes and reservoirs, representing 98.9% of global surface water storage capacity. Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) A-E relationships are included. L1 products were created using ICESat-2 and Landsat satellites, while L2 products, derived from interpolation and extrapolation, may contain errors.

Two examples are included in this repository:

1. Generation of Quality Controlled A-E Relationships.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to generate Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) A-E relationships from preliminary A-E data points.

2. Global Bathymetry Download.js
This script provides Java code to generate and download a 3D bathymetry map using Google Earth Engine. To use it, copy and paste the code into the Google Earth Engine editor, and then execute.
